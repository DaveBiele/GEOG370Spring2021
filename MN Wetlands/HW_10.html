<h1>Homework 10: Minnesota Join Project </h1>
<h2>David Biele</h2>
<h3>This map represents an intersection of current reclaimation and stabilization areas of wetlands in the Lower Mississippi River Valley in Minnesota with current wetlands found in near the reclaimation areas.   </h3>
<h4>The Data was Obtainded from Minnesota Department of Geospatial Commons</h4>
<h5>The projected projects are based off a 250 meter buffer of the current project locations.  This layer was then intersected with current wetlands within the buffer to establish likely future reclaimation areas if there is continued degradation of the wetland environemnt.  The blue represents potential future projects.  The current area can also be used as a proxy for the Mississippi flood plain in this area.  250m was used as it falls within either side of the floodplain embankments and it is spatial close enough to be likely targets if there is regression or progression in the reclaimation process.</h5>
